# Pong
# Import * from pygame library. Import random from randint library.
# Create the Game() class. Then create the Player() class which contains player movements.
# Create the background, the players and the ball using the classes that are created.
# Player 1 should control 1 paddle and Player 2 should control the other. It's just like ping pong.
